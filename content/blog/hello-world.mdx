# Hello World!

Welcome to my terminal-themed blog. This is my first post, and I'm excited to share my thoughts on web development, programming, and technology.

## What to Expect

In this blog, I'll be writing about:

- Frontend development with React and Next.js
- Terminal tricks and tips
- JavaScript best practices
- My personal projects and experiences

## Code Example

Here's a simple React component:

```jsx
function Greeting({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my blog.</p>
    </div>
  );
}
```

Stay tuned for more content coming soon!
