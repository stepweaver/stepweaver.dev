# Essential Terminal Tips for Developers

As developers, we spend a significant amount of time in the terminal. Here are some tips to make you more productive.

## Keyboard Shortcuts

- `Ctrl + A`: Move cursor to beginning of line
- `Ctrl + E`: Move cursor to end of line
- `Ctrl + K`: Delete from cursor to end of line
- `Ctrl + U`: Delete from cursor to beginning of line
- `Ctrl + W`: Delete the word behind the cursor
- `Ctrl + R`: Search command history

## Useful Commands

Here are some commands I use daily:

```bash
# Find files by name
find . -name "pattern"

# Search for text in files
grep -r "search term" .

# View file content with pagination
less filename

# Monitor file changes
tail -f logfile
```

## Setting Up Aliases

Add these to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc`:

```bash
alias ll='ls -la'
alias gs='git status'
alias gp='git push'
alias gl='git pull'
```
