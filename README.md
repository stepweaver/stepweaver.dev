This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Development Notes

### Profile Image

To display your profile picture on the site, add your image to the `public/images` directory as `profile.jpg`. The recommended size is 200x200 pixels for optimal display.

The profile image will appear in the header of every page, next to your name and role. The role displayed will change depending on which page the user is viewing.

If no profile image is found, your initials "SW" will be displayed as a fallback.
